"""
Demo version for the Proposal for Rule Initialization and Adjustment for Sensitive File Detection and Group Recommendation in Cloud Storage

NOTE: This script is a mock-up and contains placeholder functions to illustrate the overall structure of the proposed method. In the actual implementation, these placeholder functions need to be replaced with real, working versions. Furthermore, the actual implementation will need to ensure appropriate data handling, anonymization, and user privacy protection.
